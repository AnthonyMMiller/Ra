            <h1>What are Sun Flares and How Do They Affect Us?</h1>
            <p>A solar flare is a sudden flash of brightness observed near the Sun's surface. It involves a very broad
              spectrum
              of emissions, requiring an energy release of up to 6 × 1025 joules of energy (roughly the equivalent of
              160,000,000,000
              megatons of TNT... Flares are often, but not always, accompanied by a coronal mass ejection. The flare
              ejects
              clouds of electrons, ions, and atoms through the corona of the sun into space. These clouds typically
              reach Earth
              a day or two after the event. </p>

            <p>
              ​Solar flares are a space weather phenomenon that can greatly impact our human bodies and lives,
              biologically affect us,
              and consequently affect our ability to cope. They can influence our brain activity and sense of
              equilibrium,
              central nervous system, psycho-physiological and emotional self as well as behavioral tendencies. ​On a
              higher
              consciousness level they serve to transform us on a cellular level, and they can tear apart old patterns
              and
              influence us to make changes in our life, even if it is from a more sub-conscious level. This internal
              shifting
              might bring fears up to the surface.

            <p>
              "...a temporary disturbance of the Earth's magnetosphere caused by a solar wind shock wave and/or cloud
              of magnetic field
              that interacts with the Earth's magnetic field. The increase in the solar wind pressure initially
              compresses
              the magnetosphere. The solar wind's magnetic field interacts with the Earth’s magnetic field and
              transfers an
              increased energy into the magnetosphere. Both interactions cause an increase in plasma movement through
              the magnetosphere
              (driven by increased electric fields inside the magnetosphere) and an increase in electric current in the
              magnetosphere
              and ionosphere."

            <p>
              Like solar flares, it is said by some that geo-magnetic
              storms actually help us receive energetic 'downloads' and ascend as we move from our physical body to our
              'lightbody'
              (a higher energetic and spiritual state. moving closer to the higher dimensions). They offer us
              'upgrades' and
              assist in the transmutation and changing of our DNA. This is a process, not something that happens
              overnight.
              ​Geo-magnetic storms are highly transformational. They might be happening and you are not even aware of
              it and
              how it is influencing your daily life, as there are also symptoms associated with the phenomenon.
